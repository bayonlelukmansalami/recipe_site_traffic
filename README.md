## About Tasty Bytes
Tasty Bytes was founded in 2020 in the midst of the Covid Pandemic. The world wanted
inspiration so we decided to provide it. We started life as a search engine for recipes, helping
people to find ways to use up the limited supplies they had at home.
Now, over two years on, we are a fully fledged business. For a monthly subscription we will put
together a full meal plan to ensure you and your family are getting a healthy, balanced diet
whatever your budget. Subscribe to our premium plan and we will also deliver the ingredients
to your door.
